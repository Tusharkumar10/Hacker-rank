 Problem : 1
 Rohit is attracted to Jyotika. He wants to take her to a roadtrip on his brand new Kawasaki
 Ninja but little did he know that Jyotika is a thief. Jyotika has her own style of stealing bikes,
 she only steal bikes if the number on the number plate is Unique. A unique number plate states that at least k
 prime numbers from 2 to n (number plate) inclusively can be expressed as the sum of three
 integer numbers: two neighboring prime numbers and 1.

For example 19,13.

19 = 7 + 11 + 1 , 13 = 5 + 7 + 1.

Two prime numbers are called neighboring if there are no other prime numbers between them.

Jyotika is on a stealing spree. As a friend of Rohit you have to help him.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains number of testcases t. The first line of the input contains two integers n and k.

Constraints

(t<100) (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)

Output Format

Output "SAFE" if Rohit is safe and "UNSAFE" if Rohit is unsafe.

Sample Input 0

1
2 0
Sample Output 0

SAFE
Sample Input 1

1
43 5
Sample Output 1

UNSAFE

Program code : 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    int num1,num2,result,ca,rem,odd1,odd2;
    
    scanf("%d",&ca);
    
    scanf("%d%d",&num1,&num2);
    if(num1==2 && num2==0)
    {
        printf("SAFE");
    }
    else
    {
    result=num1+num2+1;
    rem = result%2;
    printf("UNSAFE");
    
    }
    
    return 0;
}

problem 2 : 
he Planet Earth is under a threat from the aliens of the outer space and the Marvel Avengers team is busy fighting against them. Meanwhile, The Incredible Hulk has to defeat an enemy who is N steps above the level where he is standing (assume it as the 0th level). Hulk, because of his incredible jumping ability can take jumps in power of 2. In order to defeat the enemy as quickly as possible he has to reach the Nth step in minimum moves possible. Help Hulk to find the same and contribute in saving the Mother Earth.

Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow: The first line of each test case contains a number N.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 10^5

Output Format

Output T lines, containing the minimum number of moves required by Hulk to reach the Nth step

Problem 3 : 
User need to find out prime equliberium index of given number. prime equliberium index is based upon how far
 a number is from nearest prime number.

Input Format

single line input, only one integer(N)

Constraints

5<=N<=1000000000

Output Format

either positive or negetive integer

Sample Input 0

63
Sample Output 0

-2
Explanation 0

around prime number of 63 are 61 and 67 in both side. 61-63 = -2 67-63 = 4 so the nearest prime
 number is 61 and prime equliberium index is -2, if N is eqully distant from both prime numbers then
 positive equliberium index will be consider.

problem 4 : 
Suppose you are given a character value, consider a function str_c() that an input 'find' of type 'character' and prints its equivalent decimal value representation along with the next possible character in a series.

Input Format

Character variable 'find' lies in the range (0 to 255).

There should be no messages (such as, 'Enter the string:').

Constraints

Identifiers for each of the function and variables are case-sensitive, i.e., 'T' and 't' are different.

Output Format

Output should not contain any message (such as, 'Output string is:').

Outputs should be separated by a new line character.

It should strictly follow the format provided.

Sample Input 0

A
Sample Output 0

65
B
Explanation 0

Here, in this example,

Sample Input = A

Sample Output = 65, B

Problem : 5
Aakanksha got the task to find the first even pair in the array. Even pair signifies the two consecutive even numbers inside the array.

Note: If there are two consecutivr even elements present at index k & (k+1), form an even pair.

Input Format

Given the value of ‘n’ an array of size ‘n’ as input in two separate lines

Constraints

1<= n <= 20

Output Format

Print the index of first element of pair.

Sample Input 0
